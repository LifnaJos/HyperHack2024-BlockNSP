This project aims to enhance the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) in India by integrating a blockchain-based scholarship module to address current challenges. The proposed system will automate the entire scholarship process, ensuring robust verification, transparent selection criteria, and efficient fund disbursement. With features such as immutable transaction history, secure authorization, and stringent compliance measures, the system will streamline the application process, reduce delays, and increase accountability among stakeholders. Ultimately, this solution seeks to alleviate students' financial insecurities, simplify their search for scholarships, and allow them to focus more on their academic pursuits.
